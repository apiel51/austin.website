      This is a list of some things that have crossed my mind. Items are placed
      in reverse chronological order.

          We often think we have 2 choices when making a decision. Too many
          people forget about the third option (door #3), which is to collect
          more information before making a decision.

          It is important to be able to cringe when looking back at things you
          did/said. It shows that you can be critical of your own behavior, and
          looking back at actions you regret is a good way to prevent behavior
          like that from surfacing again.

          I'm the happiest when I have a plan and feel like my life is in order.

          Don't shy away from doing the hard things. At some point you'll have
          to face the music.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll never have more time left in your life than you do right now.

          Journaling allows you to take a snapshot of your mental state at a
          given moment in time. This provides a solid reference point, as it can
          often be hard to recall exactly what we were thinking or how we were
          feeling in the past.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being observant allows you to learn so much more about the world.
        </li>
        <li>There's almost no better feeling than a fresh start.</li>
        <li>
          I dislike listening to music all the time. Sometimes silence is a good
          thing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being in my early twenties, I am more self-aware of my own faults than
          ever before.
        </li>

          If you feel like you need help, ask for it. You almost certainly won't
          regret it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether something is morally sound and whether it should be legal are
          two separate questions that may not have the same answer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fulfillment and pleasure are almost always at odds with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          It makes sense that most successful businesses were built by teams
          rather than individuals. Interdependence allows teams to stay
          motivated despite encountered setbacks â€” something much harder to do
          alone.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can expedite personal growth by learning to love stepping outside
          your comfort zone.
        </li>
        <li>Gratitude is a precursor to happiness.</li>
        <li>
          Let people do nice things for you. Don't fight it, be grateful
          instead. It's a win for both parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Who you spend your time around has an enormous effect on who you are.
          Try to surround yourself with people who inspire you.
